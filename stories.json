        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a famine in the land so severe that even the strongest animals were starving. The birds alone seemed well-fed, their feathers bright and their eyes sharp.\n\nThe tortoise, Mbe, hungry and cunning, approached the birds. “Friends,” he said, “teach me your secret. I will help you so none goes hungry.” At first they refused, but Mbe flattered them, calling each one gifted and wise. Finally, they agreed—and each lent him a feather, which he sewed into wings.\n\nThey invited him to join a feast hosted by the Sky God. Before they flew, Mbe declared, “We need special names in heaven. Call me ‘Everyone-of-You.’” The birds agreed and gave him the name.\n\nWhen they arrived, an attendant announced, “This banquet is for ‘Everyone-of-You.’” Mbe stepped forward and said, “I am Everyone-of-You,” then gobbled all the food before the birds could eat.\n\nFurious, the birds flew up and reclaimed their feathers—one by one—until Mbe was left stranded without wings. In desperation, he begged one bird, Parrot, to deliver a message to his wife: “Please lay out soft things below so I may land safely.”\n\nThe bird returned and lied: “He says lay out hard things.” His wife obeyed and placed hoes, spears, and cooking pots in the courtyard. Mbe leapt—falling and crashing onto the hard ground. His shell shattered into many pieces. A great healer patched it back together, but the cracks remained.\n\nFrom that day onward, the tortoise’s shell was cracked—a permanent reminder of what greed and trickery can cost one. He learned that pride may lift you up, but hubris will pull you down.",

        "text": "Mbe the tortoise considered himself the wisest of all creatures. He had proven this countless times, but as he grew older, doubt began to nag him: \"What if someone becomes wiser than I am? Who would respect me then?\" Determined to preserve his status, he devised a plan to gather all the wisdom in the world into a single gourd.\n\nFirst, he visited the birds and stole the secret of flight. Then he tricked the great Python into giving him the art of stealth. From the Elephant he took strength, from the Lion ferocity, from the giant Rat the wisdom of dungeons, and from the Antelope the knowledge of the grass's worth. \n\nAfter collecting these secrets, Mbe filled his gourd and tied it around his neck. He journeyed to the tallest palm tree in the world—the tree was said to be so high that even eagles could not reach its crown.\n\nMbe began to climb by tying himself to the trunk. But the gourd, hanging heavy on his chest, crushed him against the tree. He inched up, only to slide down again and again.\n\nWatching below, a humble snail called out: \"Why don't you hang the gourd on your back instead of the front?\"\n\nMbe scoffed but desperate, he tried the snail’s advice. This time he climbed steadily and reached the top. There, standing on the highest branch, he realized the futility of his ambition—he possessed all wisdom but lacked the humility and perspective to use it.\n\nIn shame, he hurled the gourd to the earth—it shattered, and all the wisdom scattered back across the world.\n\nReturning home without the gourd but with a lesson learned, Mbe declared aloud: \"No one can hold all the wisdom in the world!\"\n\nFrom that day forth, he stopped boasting of his intellect and instead listened to others—understanding that wisdom belongs to all, not just one.",

        "text": "In November 1929, British colonial authorities in southeastern Nigeria introduced new census procedures that alarmed Igbo women—especially the counting of ‘wives, children, and livestock,’ which hinted at imminent taxation and loss of authority. In Oloko, census-taker Mark Emereuwa instructed a widow named Nwanyeruwa to list her belongings. She challenged him: “Was your widowed mother counted?” When he grabbed her by the throat, she fled and rallied other women in the marketplace.\n\nWithin days, an estimated 10,000–25,000 women from Owerri and Calabar provinces converged on Oloko. They employed the traditional protest tactic known as “sitting on a man”—surrounding warrant chiefs, singing, dancing, and publicly shaming them into submission. They destroyed Native Court houses, burned colonial records, attacked trading posts, and freed prisoners.\n\nThe protest lasted two months. On December 17, colonial troops opened fire on the demonstrators—resulting in over 50 deaths and dozens more injuries. Despite this brutal suppression, the women achieved monumental gains: the government abandoned plans to tax women, disbanded the warrant-chief system, and allowed women to serve on Native Courts.\n\nNwanyeruwa and the “Oloko Trio” of women—Ikonnia, Nwannedia, and Nwugo—emerged as enduring symbols of resistance. Their leadership and use of nonviolent tactics sparked widespread admiration. Today, the Aba Women’s War remains a landmark achievement in African feminist history and Igbo political agency, inspiring women's activism across the continent.",
